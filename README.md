## Description
The ORWG (Our Relationship with God) web application is a project that was inspired by a local ministry's need to display questions and answers for their group. Instead of keeping something like an Excel or Word file to display these questions, I was asked to build an application that would be more appealing to the user. The most important function, however, is to give an individual access to create, update, or delete a question when necessary.

This is a full-stack application that uses MongoDB for data storage, Express and Node.js for running the server, and a template engine (EJS) for rendering views based on user authentification. An admin is allowed to login and create a session upon successful entry. Once authorized, the admin can make changes as needed and simply logout once the work is done!

Admin access serves a huge purpose, as a customer can update their own data without the need of my services.
